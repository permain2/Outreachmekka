## **üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

### **Phone Call Strategy Works When:**
- Higher deal values ($1,500+ per creator)
- Complex negotiations needed
- Want higher close rates
- Targeting fewer, higher-quality creators

### **DM-Only Strategy Works When:**
- Lower deal values ($25-40 per video)
- High volume approach
- Simple yes/no offers
- Quick decision turnaround needed

### **Universal Principles:**
1. **Always start with "PAID PROMO"** in first line
2. **Use verified brand accounts** for higher response rates
3. **Never negotiate complex terms via DM**
4. **Volume is key** - expect 1-2% response rates
5. **VAs can handle initial outreach** effectively

### **The Phone Call Advantage:**
*"If you do it over messages you give them a lot of space to like think about it and negotiate whereas if you get on a call like they're very in the moment it's very easy to say yes"* - Quitter App Founder

**Bottom Line:** Phone calls = Higher close rates but lower volume. DMs = Lower close rates but massive scale. Choose based on your deal size and target creator quality.
