# üéØ INFLUENCER OUTREACH SOP
## Time Tracker App - Virtual Assistant Playbook

---

## üìã **OVERVIEW**
You are responsible for finding and recruiting micro-influencers to create content for our time tracker app. This system is based on proven strategies from companies doing $1M+ per month.

**üéØ GOAL:** Recruit 50+ active creators posting 4 videos per month each

---

## üîç **PHASE 1: CREATOR DISCOVERY**

### **Step 1: Algorithm Training (Week 1)**
1. **Create 3 NEW TikTok accounts** using different emails
   - Account names: `productivity_scout_1`, `productivity_scout_2`, `productivity_scout_3`
   
2. **Train each algorithm by ONLY engaging with:**
   - ‚úÖ Productivity content
   - ‚úÖ Time management videos  
   - ‚úÖ Study/work routines
   - ‚úÖ Self-improvement content
   - ‚úÖ Student/entrepreneur lifestyle
   - ‚ùå DO NOT engage with anything else

3. **Daily scrolling requirement:** 2 hours total (40 mins per account)

### **Step 2: Creator Identification**
**TARGET PROFILE:**
- **Followers:** 3,000 - 15,000
- **Content:** Productivity, time management, study tips, work routines
- **Posted:** At least 3 videos (shows they're past initial embarrassment)
- **Engagement:** 5%+ engagement rate
- **Age:** 18-25 (Gen Z creators understand the platform better)

**RED FLAGS TO AVOID:**
- All comments are from other influencers (engagement pods)
- Same accounts commenting on every video
- Identical comment patterns across videos
- Comments don't relate to video content

```

---

## üìû **PHONE CALL STRATEGY**

### **Call Objectives:**
1. Get them excited about helping people be more productive
2. Explain the bundle deal (4 videos = better rate)
3. Lock in the deal before they have time to overthink

### **Call Script Outline:**
```
"Hey [NAME]! Thanks for hopping on...

So we're [APP NAME] - we help people actually track their time instead of just guessing where it goes.

The thing is, your audience is EXACTLY who needs this. Students, young professionals, people trying to optimize their day.

Here's how it works:
- You make 4 videos over the next month showing how you use the app
- We pay you $120 upfront (that's $30 per video)
- If any video hits 500K views, you get a $500 bonus
- If it hits 1M views, that's a $1000 bonus
- Plus you're genuinely helping your audience be more productive

The content is super natural - just 'day in my life' style showing you tracking your time. No salesy scripts.

Sound good? I can send the contract over today and get you paid this week."
```

### **Common Objections & Responses:**
**"That's too low, I usually charge $500 per video"**
‚Üí "I get it, but this is 4 videos upfront plus potential bonuses. Plus it's authentic content that actually helps your audience. Let's start here and if it performs well, we can definitely discuss higher rates for future months."

**"I don't know if my audience wants productivity content"**
‚Üí "Looking at your content, you're already posting about routines and optimization. This is just showing one tool that helps with that. Your audience follows you for productivity tips, right?"

**"I need to think about it"**
‚Üí "Totally understand. Just so you know, we're only taking on 10 new creators this month and I have 3 spots left. If you want to lock it in, I can send the contract today. If not, no worries - maybe next month!"
